Published in [New England Journal of Medicine](http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2112090).

For this study, we set the [Guinness World Record](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/675050-fastest%C2%A0dna-sequencing%C2%A0technique) for fastest sequencing technique.
We sequenced a patient and called variants (SNVs/indels/SVs) in **five hours and two minutes**.
